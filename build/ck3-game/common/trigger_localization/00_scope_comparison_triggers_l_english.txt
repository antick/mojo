#	The following comparison triggers require changing scopes between the characters (e.g., root.faith.religious_head passes through 'faith' between 'root' and 'religious_head')
#	As a result they are too complex for simple trigger localization, and will need to have custom localization written whenever they are used:
#	 religious_head
#	 house_head
#	 dynast
